## Dim

A tiny menubar Mac app for multi-monitor users. Automatically dims your secondary screen when you start fullscreen video. You can see it in action in the [demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVGFIJ6b34c&feature=youtu.be). Now open-sourced and compatible with Yosemite.

### Tested on
- OS X 10.9.x + Safari 7 + Firefox
- OS X 10.10 DP3 + Safari 8

Should work on 10.8 too!

No Chrome support at the moment, blame Google for their useless AppleScript Chrome API.
